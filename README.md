# FlorenceSAMBlur-
FlorenceSAMBlur is a project that utilizes Florence2 for detecting main speakers and all faces in a video frame. After filtering, it uses SAM2 to generate masks for all non-main speaker faces. These masked faces are then blurred or replaced to ensure privacy and focus on the main speaker.
